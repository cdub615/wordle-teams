/**
 * THE ROUTES THAT EXIST BECAUSE SOMETHING OUTSIDE THIS REPO POINTS AT THEM.
 *
 * A route the app itself never links to is invisible to every gate we run: the
 * four in .github/workflows/deploy-v2.yml are lint, typecheck, `vitest run` and
 * build, and none of them can tell a deliberately unreferenced route from dead
 * code. `/me` was exactly that. Deleting src/routes/me.tsx left all four green
 * — routeTree.gen.ts simply regenerated without it — and only e2e/routes.spec.ts
 * noticed, which CI does not run. So the one route whose entire justification
 * is "production PWA installs have /me burned in and cannot be updated" could
 * be tidied away and shipped to beta on a green build.
 *
 * BOTH HALVES ARE ASSERTED, DELIBERATELY.
 *
 * The SOURCE file pins the redirect's target, which is the part that matters
 * to a user and the part no generated artefact records: routeTree.gen.ts knows
 * `/me` exists, not where it sends anyone. Retargeting it at `/login` was green
 * on all four gates too.
 *
 * The GENERATED tree pins existence independently of the file's name, so a
 * rename or a move of the source still goes red here rather than silently
 * dropping the path. It is checked in (`git ls-files src/routeTree.gen.ts`), so
 * it is a real artefact of the commit and not a build-time coincidence.
 *
 * Reading files as strings rather than importing them is the pattern
 * src/lib/sw-push.test.ts already uses to pin the push payload against its
 * server copy; the reason is the same here. The route module cannot be
 * imported in this environment — createFileRoute registers against a router
 * that does not exist under vitest — and a `redirect()` thrown from beforeLoad
 * is only observable with a running router. The string IS the artefact that
 * ships.

/**
 * THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN `/` AND `/home`, WHICH IS THE MOST-ARGUED DECISION IN
 * PHASE 7 TASK 4 AND HAD NO TEST AT ALL.
 *
 * v1's `welcomePaths` (src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts:7) is exactly
 * `['/', '/login']`. `/home` is deliberately absent, so a signed-in visitor who
 * follows a link there gets the marketing page rather than a bounce — the
 * bounce exists to keep a relaunching iOS PWA off the welcome screen, and no
 * PWA relaunches onto /home. Both route files carry paragraphs about this.
 *
 * MUTATION FOUND THE HOLE: adding a `beforeLoad` to src/routes/home.tsx left
 * all 39 e2e specs green, because the only /home test navigated anonymously and
 * a signed-in-only redirect is invisible to an anonymous visit. e2e/routes.spec
 * .ts now signs in and walks the redirect chain, which is the BEHAVIOURAL half.
 * This is the half CI can see — .github/workflows/deploy-v2.yml runs lint,
 * typecheck, `vitest run` and build, and no e2e.
 *
 * Same string-reading rationale as the /me block above: createFileRoute cannot
 * be imported under vitest, and a thrown `redirect()` needs a running router to
 * be observable.
